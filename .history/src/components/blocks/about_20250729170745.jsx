            About The Braybank Estate
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-5 leading-relaxed">
            The Braybank Estate is situated on the banks of the River Thames in Bray village, some
            2 miles from Maidenhead and 4 miles from Windsor, Berkshire. The gated community is
            home to 62 properties of which 14 are town houses and 48 flats.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-5">
            The estate is managed by a board of directors under a limited company. The objective
            of the board is to ensure the smooth running of the estate and work with a managing
            agent to oversee the day-to-day running of the estate.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-5">
            All dwellings are Leasehold and the Freehold of Braybank is owned by Braybank
            Estates Limited (BEL) in which most Leaseholders hold one of the 62 shares. The
            Company is managed by a Board of up to seven Directors, all themselves
            Shareholders, who are elected at an Annual General Meeting. The Board is in place as a
            requirement of the Companies Act to carry out a legal and co-ordinating role on behalf
            of all Shareholders.
